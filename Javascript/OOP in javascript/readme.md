# Prototype
In javscript, all data except boolean, number, string, null, and undefined is objects.<br>
Javascript is a prototype-based OOP language where objects are inherited without a class.<br>
Each object in javascript is connected to their parent object. The parent object is called "*prototype object**.<br>
The inheritance in javascript is performed through **prototype chain**.
The chain ends when it reaches a prototype whose parent prototype is null.<br>
