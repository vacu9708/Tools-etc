### Hyperlink
something you can click on to jump to another place of the web. (It creates a nonlinear network of information)

### The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML
the standard markup language that is used to create documents on the Web (which allows incorporating hypermedia such as text, graphics, sound, video, and so on).

### HTTP and HTTPS
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting HTML documents where security is not considered.
In HTTPS, the communication is encrypted using SSL handshake.(or Transport Layer Security). It is secure but delays the speed of the website.

## Restful API
### A restful API consists of
* HTTP methods(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* URL like http://myweb/users, called *resource*
* message(in a form of either JSON or XML)

A restful API has to be *self-descriptive*, in other words, contain enough information that represents what it does.
