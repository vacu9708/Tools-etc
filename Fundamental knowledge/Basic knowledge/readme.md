# Hyperlink
something you can click on to jump to another place of the web. (It creates a nonlinear network of information)

# URI, URL
- URI: A unique string to identify a resource (e.g. www.example.com)
- URL: URI + protocol (e.g. http://www.example.com)

# The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML
the standard markup language that is used to define the structure of a webpage(, which can include hypermedia such as text, graphics, sound, video, and so on).

# HTTP and HTTPS
- **HTTP**: a stateless, insecure protocol for a client and a server to communicate, comprised of a request and a response.
- **HTTPS**: HTTP that is encrypted using SSL handshake. It is secure but delays the speed of the website.

# HTTP methods
- **GET** is used to request data where the request parameter is appended to the URL and has a length restriction.
- **POST** is used to send data to a server where the request parameter is appended into the HTTP body doesn't have a length restriction.
- PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc

# RESTful API
An API that obeys the REST constraints is described as RESTful API.<br>
Server side framework can be just about anything thanks to RESTful API that abstracts the implementation.
## A restful API
- has uniform interface for communication between clients and servers, including an HTTP method(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc) + URL. (e.g. GET https://myweb/users)
- does not maintain any client state 

One of the REST constraints is *self-descriptive*, which means an API has to contain enough information that represents what it does.<br>

# API
- An API allows different software applications to communicate.
- An open API is an API publicly available.
- An OpenAPI is a specification for describing RESTful APIs, which allows for the automatic generation of code, documentation, and tests based on the API specification.

# UI/UX
UI refers to visual elements that users interact with. UX refers more generally to users' overall experience, including how they feel about the interaction.
