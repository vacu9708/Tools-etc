# Basics
- Inversion of control: Instead of a program controlling the objects it uses, the control is shifted to a separate framework.
- ## Dependency Injection
  [Dependency Inversion](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/blob/main/Etc/Object%20Oriented%20Programming) is automated by the spring annotation **@Autowired**, which is called **Dependency Injection**. @Autowired is also automated in Spring.
